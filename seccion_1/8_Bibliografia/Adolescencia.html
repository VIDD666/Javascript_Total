Believed to have been conceived by the midi-chlorians,
Anakin Skywalker was born to the slave Shmi Skywalker.
As he grew, Skywalker's exceptional skills made him cocky,
but he nevertheless idolized Kenobi,thinking there was
"no one better" than his master. Having given up his life 
with his mother and lost Jinn, Skywalker clinged 
to his master, not wanting to lose him; throughout his 
first year as a Padawan, he had a habit of sleeping on the
floor next to Kenobi's bed, wanting to ensure his mentor would
not vanish in the night.
Kenobi sometimes awoke at night and saw this.
During one of their many adventures, he also rescued Kenobi 
after he fell into a nest of gundarks.</p>
